                 others - are based on MCE list to check
                 if age or sex for a beneficiary is within the
                 range of acceptable age/sex, if not- CC is set to 
                 -1.0 - invalid
 3  PARAMETERS:  AGE   - beneficiary age variable calculated by DOB

 4  COMMENTS:    1. Age format AGEFMT0 and sex format SEXFMT0 are 
                    parameters in the main macro. They have to 
                    correspond to the years of data

                 2. If ICD10 code does not have any restriction on age
                    or sex then the corresponding format puts it in "-1"

                    AGEU format sets upper limit for age
